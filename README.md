A modern implementation of gradient-enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks (gPINNs) for solving the inverse Brinkman-Forchheimer problem in porous media flow. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to infer hidden rock properties from sparse sensor measurements.

## 🚀 Overview

This project addresses a critical challenge in geothermal energy exploration: determining the permeability and effective viscosity of underground rock formations using minimal sensor data. By combining physics-based constraints with neural networks, our gPINN solver can accurately predict rock properties that would otherwise require expensive drilling operations.

### The Physics

The Brinkman-Forchheimer equation models fluid flow through porous media:

```
-νₑ * d²u/dx² + (ν/K) * u = g
```

Where:
- `νₑ`: Effective viscosity (unknown parameter to infer)
- `K`: Permeability (unknown parameter to infer)  
- `u(x)`: Fluid velocity field
- `ν`: Known fluid viscosity
- `g`: Known pressure gradient
